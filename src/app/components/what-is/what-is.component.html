<h1>What is Orienteering?</h1>
An exciting outdoor adventure sport which involves walking or running whilst navigating around a course using a detailed map and sometimes a compass.
The aim is to navigate between a set of control points, deciding on the best route to complete the course in the quickest time.
It does not matter how young, old or fit you are - you can run, walk or jog the course and progress at your own pace.

    Orienteering events are held anywhere from remote forest and countryside to urban parks and school playgrounds. Itâ€™s a great sport for runners, joggers and walkers who want to improve their navigation skills or for anyone who loves the outdoors.
<h1>What equipment do I need?</h1>
The basic equipment required for orienteering is simply a compass and appropriate outdoor clothing. Competitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment:

A thumb compass, or protractor compass on a short wrist cord.
A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions.
A clear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptions.
IOF rules forbid the use of artificial aids that competitors can refer to during a race, so GPS and other electronic navigation devices are not used.
<h1>Where do I get a map from?</h1>
The map is provided as part of the event. Orienteering maps are specially drawn in great detail with standard IOF symbols.

Typically drawn at a scale of 1:15 000 or 1:10 000, the map includes features like streams, trails, hills, depressions, rocks etc.
